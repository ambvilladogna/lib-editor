The window._books / window._config / window._filterBooks bridge works fine for now, 
but as you add more features (sync UI, config editing, etc.) that pattern will start to feel awkward. 
At some point it might be worth extracting a small store.js — just a plain object holding the shared state and mutation helpers — that both script.js and editor.js import from.
No framework needed, just a cleaner seam.
The other thing on the horizon is the sync flow — right now edits hit the API and update the JSON files, 
but nothing pushes to GitHub Pages. The POST /api/sync/push endpoint is already there waiting. 
A natural place for that UI would be a small status indicator in the header (dirty/ahead count) with a push button, using notify.js for feedback. 
That would round out the full edit → commit → deploy loop.
